# A SIMPLE TIC TAC TOE GAME

As part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum, I created a simple Tic Tac Toe game - live preview [here](https://s111ew.github.io/js-object-library/).

After previously learning about the potential drawbacks of using object constructors, I implemented factory functions and closures in order to eliminate global variables from my code. I learnt about scope and the positives of only exposing certain methods of an object.
